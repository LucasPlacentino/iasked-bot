# "I Asked" Discord Bot 🤖
A Discord "Who asked?", "I did" bot.  

Make your Discord servers friendlier.  

## 🎾 Features
Replies "I asked", "I did" or "Me" to any message containing variations of "Who asked?"  

## Setup

  as well as `Send Message`, `Read Messages/View Channels`, `Read Message History` and `Add Reactions` permissions!  

This can be enabled in your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers), in your app and bot's settings and when creating the bot invite link there.
